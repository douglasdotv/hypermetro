This application simulates metro system navigation using a graph data structure and Dijkstra's algorithm for pathfinding. It reads metro lines and stations data from a JSON file and allows users to perform operations such as adding or removing stations (vertices), connecting different lines, and finding the shortest or fastest paths between stations via CLI. It serves primarily as a practical tool for understanding the application of graphs in software development. The Gson library was used for reading JSON files, and the strategy design pattern was employed to easily handle the available commands.
